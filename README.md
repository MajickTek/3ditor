# 3ditor

I always searched for a clean little 3D level editor, where you can visually place your 3D models and save this scene to a file.
But unfortunately the only level editors I've come across were for 2D only or integrated in big engines (Unreal, Unity, ...).
So I have decided to write my own and here it is: a standalone 3D level editor.

## Basic Usage

You may already have it, but if not, create one: a base directory, with all your 3D assets in it.
It is no problem, if your models are managed within subdirectories.
Choose this directory as your base directory.
